# Exploring-Vaccine-Hesitancy
The purpose of this project is to shed some light on the complexity of a person's unwillingness to take vaccines. This paper shows this is a multi-faceted problem rather than simply lack of information. This is a highly relevant topic in the current world as news reports often show the binary difference among the population. Often, hesitant people are labelled as anti-vaxxers and their worries are often dismissed. Since taking the vaccine affects their body, it is important to reach them based in their views and come up with alternative methods of educating them on the safety of vaccines.
