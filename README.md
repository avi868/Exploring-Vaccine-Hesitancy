# Exploring-Vaccine-Hesitancy
This project seeks to provide more insight into the reasons behind people who are hesitant to take vaccines. 
As outlined in the paper, this does not seem to be an issue of simple lack of information, rather it is a multi-faceted problem with predictors such as
education level, religion and even age. This topic is highly relevent in the current world as there seems to be a segregation of the public into the binary of
pro and anti vaxxers. This paper attempts to highlight some ways in which we can address the concerns of those unwilling to take the vaccine. Simple applying mandatory 
vaccinations does not seem to be much help since that is the cause of worldwide protest and can cause even further distrust in local and federal government.
